GRADS Assignment

Backend development of a graduation percentage calculator. 

Allows for two types of users to log in with varying admin rights: Advisor and Student
Advisors can change all information for a student except immutable items such as name, student id, etc.
Advisors can also see all students within their advising department while students can only see themselves.

User files are imported in a JSON formatted and a students graduation percentage is then generated based on completed classes taken when compared to graduation requirements of that students major.

Students and Advisors can also create a theoretical schedule and be shown a new graduation percentage based on potentially taken classes.
